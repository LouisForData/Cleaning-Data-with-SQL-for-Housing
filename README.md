## Nashville Data Cleaning Project
### Overview

This project focuses on cleaning a dataset from Nashville. The script, written in SQL, addresses common data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies. The purpose is to prepare the dataset for further analysis and ensure that it meets high standards of data integrity.
### Features

    Data Cleaning: The SQL script includes procedures for handling:
        Missing or null values
        Duplicated entries
        Standardizing formats (e.g., dates, strings)
        Removing outliers
    Optimized SQL Queries: The script uses efficient SQL techniques to ensure fast and accurate data cleaning processes.

## File Structure

    ProjectCleaningDataNashville.sql: Contains all the SQL statements used for cleaning the Nashville dataset.

## Prerequisites

    Database Management System: Ensure you have a working SQL environment such as:
        MySQL
        PostgreSQL
        Microsoft SQL Server
        SQLite
    Dataset: You will need access to the raw Nashville dataset before running the SQL script.

### How to Use

  1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

  [git clone https://github.com/LouisForData/NashvilleDataCleaning.git](https://github.com/LouisForData/Cleaning-Data-with-SQL-for-Housing)

  2. Set up your database and import the dataset. Make sure the table names and schema match the ones in the SQL script.

3. Run the SQL script:

    Open the ProjectCleaningDataNashville.sql file in your SQL editor.
    Execute the script to clean the dataset.

4. Validate the cleaned data by querying the updated tables to check for any remaining inconsistencies.
